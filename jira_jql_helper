#Sample JQL for JIRA dashboards
#
#

#no sub-task inheritance automation in any of our workflows.  The philosophy is that fields of sub-tasks are expected to be the same as their parents so we donâ€™t repeat them on the sub-tasks screens.

#Create association to an Agile Scrum Board when there exists a Parent - Child relationship and one Key for scrum board display

#Proposed Solution:
(project=MAINProject and "Scrum Team"= SomeScrumTeam13) or issueFunction in subtasksOf("project=MAINProject and 'Scrum Team'=SomeScrumTeam13") 

#Embedded Filters withing Filters for Ease of Managing dynamic aspects of JQL such as: Scrum Teams per fiscal year in QBO
project = MAINProject AND issuetype = Bug AND "Environment - QBO" = PRODUCTION AND filter = "QBO Engineering Excellence Metrics Week Date Range (Last Wed-Current Week)"
